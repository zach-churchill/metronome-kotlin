# Metronome App with Kotlin

I wanted to see if I could create my own metronome app, so I decided to give Kotlin and Android app development a try. This repository contains the source code for my app since I currently only want this project to serve as an example of my software development skills instead of actually putting this app on the Google Play Store.

# App Demo

Below I wanted to provide a simple demo of the application using a GIF. You will see how I have designed the app to provide the user with visual cues for when buttons are disabled based on whether the metronome is toggled on or if the beats per minute is not within the limits (via user input).
**Note:** The pixelated view of the app is due to resizing the GIF.
